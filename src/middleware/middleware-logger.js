// This basic middleware is doing a few things:

// First it logs the current state of our store to the console.

// Then it logs the action that was dispatched to invoke it.

// We then call next(), and pass in our action. This instructs Redux to continue its normal 'workflow'. (Allowing the action to continue to the reducer).

// Finally, we log the results of store.getState() again to see how state has changed after we "unpause" and allow the action to reach the reducer.
